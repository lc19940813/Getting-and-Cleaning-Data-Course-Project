# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project

This is Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project from Data Science Track of Coursera  

---  

##Background
One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing - see for example this article.  

Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

Here are the data for the project:

##run_analysis.R

In this R file, I did the following things to the raw data:  

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

Ultimately, I obtained the desired tidy data named Final_data.txt which satisfied the basic principles of tidy data.

##CodeBook.md
In this CodeBook, I modifies and updates the available codebooks with the data to indicate all the variables and summaries calculated, along with units, and any other relevant information. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me.
